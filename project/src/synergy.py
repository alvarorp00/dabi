    This class implements the synergy boost metaheuristic.
    It takes a list of metaheuristics (sees them as black boxes) and
    returns the best solution found by any of the metaheuristics.

    The idea is that this class will be used to share knowledge between
    metaheuristics, so that they can learn from each other.

    It is not done yet.
